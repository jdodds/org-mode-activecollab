I'm hoping that at some point in the totally awesome future, this will be a
complete-enough-for-me set of integration helpers for working with ActiveCollab
bugtrackers.

I currently have a function that can be used as a `:formatter` line to
`org-feed-alist`, which allows incoming RSS entries to be inserted as a heading
with a non-ugly link and (hopefully) useful info.

Planned crap includes updating ActiveCollab when changing TODO states. I'm
familiar enough with their API(s) to know that this is not only going to be
incredibly useful, but also a pain.
